            <h1>Euclidean Rhythms</h1>
            <p>Developed an application in vanilla JS to generate Euclidean Rhythms as part of a presentation for my college's
                STEM club. The application is drawn on a canvas and rendered through WebGL using Phaser. The sounds are played using Midi.js.
                These rhythms are generated using the bjorklund algorithm developed by George Toussaint. A detailed explanation can be read 
                in the outline I wrote for my presentation

            <h1>JavaRPG</h1>
            <p> A simple turn based rpg developed for my intro to programming class, made entirely with the Java standard library.
                As part of my requirements in developing the project I was required to display my understanding of OOP principles.
                Because of this abilities/skills and even AI are all extending from a base class that defines a simple interface
                for them to be given the data they need to operate on. Positions of characters are determined using an 8-bit bitmask. Key programming
                concerns when developing this application were extending the gradient class and drawing operations my professor had given
                me to work on any screen resolution.

            <h1>Gentry</h1>
            <p>A strategy game developed in Javascript using the Phaser framework. Gameplay loops consisted of dialogue segment that were
                scripted using an extended version of the node editor developed by <a href="https://github.com/etodd">Evan Todd</a>.
                His editor and implementation only supported parsing raw text due to him only needed to display simple text on the screen for his project. 
                My extensions primarily consisted of adding new node definitions for audioclips/drawing sprites/utility and implementing a functionality
                for parsing mathematical expressesions and handling tasks such as substring coloring. The graph was represented using an
                adjacency list so I needed to roll my own parser using REGEX for finding closed brackets, a FSM(Finite State Machine) 
                for handling node states and then using a recursive decent parser to handle the mathematical expressions.
                The rpg side of things was handled using a GOAP(Goal Oriented Action Planner) for enemies to choose their actions and the
                Command Queue design pattern for handling player actions. This means that each action chosen for a turn would be stored in Queue
                and would then be performed as elements are dequeued.

            <p>A simple 2D game engine developed using the Monoframework and C# language. Moonsharp was used to integrate Lua support.

            <h1>Digivolution Graphs</h1>
            <p>An application for analyzing digivolutions in digimon games. This tool was made for personal use in gameplays.
                The data for this application is provided from a custom webscraper I developed in NodeJS.

            <h1>Rotating Calipers</h1>
            <p>An implementation of the Rotating Calipers algorithm which was initially made by Michael Shamos.
                This was developed for my Data Structures & Algorithms Final project where we were tasked to choose
                any algorithm and then implement and explain it. I chose to implement the Rotating Calipers due to my recent
                interest in computational geomtry.

            <h1>Algorithms Presentation</h1>
            <p>A presentation on algorithms given for a communications class. I chose to explain the concept of
                iterative and greedy algorithms using a discrete distance optimization problem involving finding
                the best spot to open a lemonade stand to finding the smallest demonination of coins to hand
                    out to meet a prespecified amount.

            <h1>Current Work</h1>
            <p>I am currently developing a graphing calculator for visualizing dynamic algorithms using 
                tropical geometry as part of my senior capstone, this is being developed using ReactJS
                for the frontend interface and ThreeJS for rendering the polyhedra and tropical curves.
                As a side project I am developing an Adventure game in the 
                Godot Game engine that is an extension from my entry in the Yogscast game jam.
